## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ HIGH RISK
1. **Matching Algorithm Complexity** (Sprint 2)
   - **Risk:** Algorithm may not scale or provide good matches
   - **Mitigation:** Start with simple distance-based matching, iterate with AI later
   - **Fallback:** Manual driver selection by rider

2. **WebSocket Stability** (Sprint 3)
   - **Risk:** WebSocket connections may be unstable on mobile networks
   - **Mitigation:** Implement reconnection logic, graceful fallback to polling
   - **Fallback:** HTTP polling every 5 seconds for location updates

3. **Real-Time Location Performance** (Sprint 3)
   - **Risk:** High-frequency location updates may overload server
   - **Mitigation:** Implement throttling, caching (Redis), and rate limiting
   - **Fallback:** Reduce update frequency to 30 seconds

### üü° MEDIUM RISK
4. **Payment Integration** (Sprint 2)

# üéØ Conclusion

This sprint planning provides a **realistic 12-week roadmap** to deliver a fully functional Motorbike Sharing System MVP. The plan prioritizes:

1. **Core Functionality First** (Sprints 1-2) - Without ride booking/matching, the app has no purpose
2. **Safety & Trust** (Sprints 3-4) - Critical for university student target audience
3. **User Experience** (Sprint 5) - Ratings, notifications, messaging enhance engagement
4. **Business Viability** (Sprint 6) - Promotions, analytics, admin tools for sustainable operation

**Key Success Factors:**
- ‚úÖ Clear priorities and well-defined user stories
- ‚úÖ Realistic time estimates with buffer
- ‚úÖ Risk mitigation strategies
- ‚úÖ Mobile team coordination
- ‚úÖ Incremental delivery with staging deployments
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing at each sprint

**Next Steps:**
1. Validate sprint plan with team
2. Set up development environment
3. Kickoff Sprint 1
4. Coordinate with mobile team for API contracts
5. Begin implementation! üöÄ
