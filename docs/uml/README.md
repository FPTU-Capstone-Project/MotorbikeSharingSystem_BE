## Viewing Diagrams

These diagrams use Mermaid syntax, which is supported by:
- GitHub (renders automatically)
- GitLab (renders automatically)  
- VS Code (with Mermaid extension)
- Many documentation tools

## For Non-Technical Readers

These diagrams are like blueprints for a building - they show:
- **Entity Diagrams**: What data we store and how it connects (like filing cabinet organization)
- **Class Diagrams**: What components exist and how they work together (like department organizational chart)
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Step-by-step processes (like workflow diagrams)
- **Component Diagrams**: High-level system structure (like building floor plans)

## For Technical Readers

All diagrams follow UML 2.5 standards and use Mermaid syntax for:
- Version control compatibility
- Easy editing and maintenance
- Automatic rendering in documentation platforms
- Integration with development workflows
