## **Choose Your Setup Path**

### **For Non-Technical Users or First-Time Setup**
ðŸ‘‡ **Follow the [Complete Step-by-Step Guide](#complete-setup-guide-step-by-step)** below
- Detailed instructions from installing software to running the app
- Works for Mac and Windows
- No prior knowledge required

### **For Developers (Quick Start)**
If you already have Docker and know how to use bash/terminal:

```bash
# Clone/download project and navigate to directory
cd MotorbikeSharingSystem_BE

# Make script executable and run
chmod +x dev.sh
./dev.sh

# Access app at http://localhost:8081
# Stop with: ./dev.sh stop
```

**Requirements:** Docker Desktop running, bash terminal (Git Bash on Windows)

---

## Complete Setup Guide (Step by Step)

Follow these steps exactly - they work for both beginners and experienced developers.

### Step 1: Download and Install Required Software

**You need these two things:**

1. **Docker Desktop** - Download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   - Install Docker Desktop
   - Start Docker Desktop application
   - Wait for it to show "Docker Desktop is running" (green icon)

2. **VS Code** - Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Install VS Code
   - This will be where you open the project

### Step 2: Get the Project Code

1. **Download or Clone** this project to your computer
2. **Remember the location** where you saved it (e.g., Desktop, Documents, etc.)

### Step 3: Open Project in VS Code

1. **Open VS Code**
2. Click **"File"** â†’ **"Open Folder"** (Mac) or **"Open Folder"** (Windows)
3. **Navigate to** and **select** the `MotorbikeSharingSystem_BE` folder
4. Click **"Open"** or **"Select Folder"**

### Step 4: Open the Correct Terminal in VS Code

This is the **most important step** - you need the right type of terminal:

#### For Mac Users:
1. In VS Code, press **`Ctrl + ` `** (backtick key, usually above Tab key)
   - Or go to menu: **View â†’ Terminal**
2. The terminal will open at the bottom of VS Code
3. Make sure it shows something like:
   ```
   username@MacBook-Pro MotorbikeSharingSystem_BE %
   ```
4. **This is correct** - Mac uses bash/zsh terminal by default

#### For Windows Users:
1. In VS Code, press **`Ctrl + ` `** (backtick key, usually above Tab key)
   - Or go to menu: **View â†’ Terminal**
2. **Check what terminal type opened** - look at the terminal tab name:
   
   **If you see "PowerShell" or "Command Prompt":**
   - Click the **dropdown arrow** next to the "+" button in terminal
   - Select **"Git Bash"** (if available) or **"Bash"**
   - If Git Bash is not available, install **Git for Windows** first from https://git-scm.com/download/win
   
   **You want to see "Git Bash" or "Bash"**
   
3. The correct terminal should show something like:
   ```
   username@DESKTOP-XXX MINGW64 ~/MotorbikeSharingSystem_BE
   $
   ```

#### If Git Bash is Not Available (Windows Only):
1. **Install Git for Windows**:
   - Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - Download and install (use default settings)
   - Restart VS Code
2. **Try opening terminal again** and select "Git Bash"

### Step 5: Verify You're in the Right Directory

In your terminal (Mac or Windows), type this command and press Enter:

```bash
ls
```

**You should see these files:**
- `dev.sh`
- `pom.xml`
- `src/`
- `README.md`
- Other project files

**If you don't see these files:**
- You're in the wrong directory
- Type: `cd MotorbikeSharingSystem_BE` and press Enter
- Try `ls` again

### Step 6: Make the Script Executable (Required)

In your terminal, run this command:

```bash
chmod +x dev.sh
```

This makes the script runnable on your system.

### Step 7: Start the Application

Now run the magic command:

```bash
./dev.sh
```

**What you'll see:**
- Lots of text scrolling (this is normal)
- Messages about Docker containers starting
- Eventually: "Application is ready!"

**When it's ready:**
- Your application will be running at http://localhost:8081
- Keep the terminal open - don't close it

### Step 8: Test It's Working

1. **Open your web browser**
2. **Go to:** http://localhost:8081
3. **You should see** the application running (might be a JSON response or API page)
4. **Also try:** http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html for API documentation

### Step 9: Stop the Application (When Done)

When you're finished working:

```bash
./dev.sh stop
```

This safely stops everything and cleans up.

## Quick Start (After Initial Setup)

Once you've done the setup above once, daily usage is simple:

```bash
# Start your development day (in VS Code terminal)
./dev.sh

# Stop when done
./dev.sh stop
```

## Visual Guide Summary

**What success looks like:**

1. **VS Code is open** with your project folder
2. **Terminal is open** at the bottom (Git Bash on Windows, Terminal on Mac)
3. **Terminal shows** the project directory: `~/MotorbikeSharingSystem_BE`
4. **Docker Desktop** shows green "running" status
5. **After running `./dev.sh`**: Browser shows app at http://localhost:8081

**Signs something is wrong:**
- Terminal says "PowerShell" (Windows) - switch to Git Bash
- `ls` command doesn't show `dev.sh` file - wrong directory
- `./dev.sh` says "permission denied" - run `chmod +x dev.sh` first
- Docker errors - make sure Docker Desktop is running

---

## Prerequisites

You only need one thing installed on your computer:

**Docker Desktop** - Download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

- Install Docker Desktop
- Start Docker Desktop (wait for it to show "running")
- That's all you need!

**You don't need to install:**
- Java
- Maven
- PostgreSQL
- Any other development tools

Everything runs inside Docker containers.

## Development Setup

### Method 1: One Command Setup (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started:

```bash
./dev.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Checks if Docker is running
- Starts PostgreSQL database in a container
- Builds and starts your Spring Boot application
- Shows you all the URLs and connection info

**To stop everything:**
```bash
./dev.sh stop
```

<details>
<summary>Method 2: Step by Step (if you want more control)</summary>

```bash
# Start the development environment
./dev.sh start

# View application logs
docker logs motorbike-dev-app -f

# View database logs  
docker logs motorbike-dev-db -f

# Stop everything
./dev.sh stop
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Method 3: Manual Docker Commands (for advanced users)</summary>

If you want to understand what's happening behind the scenes:

```bash
# Start database
docker run -d --name motorbike-dev-db \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=motorbike_sharing_db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Password@123 \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:15-alpine

# Build application (run from project directory)
docker build -t motorbike-dev-app .

# Start application
docker run -d --name motorbike-dev-app \
  -p 8081:8080 \
  -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://[DB_IP]:5432/motorbike_sharing_db \
  motorbike-dev-app
```

</details>

## Available Services

Once started, you can access:

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Main Application** | http://localhost:8081 | Your Spring Boot API |
| **API Documentation** | http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html | Interactive API docs |

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development

```bash
# Start your development day
./dev.sh

# Make your code changes
# The application will automatically rebuild when you restart

# View logs if something goes wrong
docker logs motorbike-dev-app -f

# End your development day
./dev.sh stop
```

### Making Code Changes

When you change your code:

1. Stop the current application: `./dev.sh stop`
2. Start again: `./dev.sh`
3. Your changes will be included in the new build

### Database Management

Your database data is automatically saved between restarts.

<details>
<summary>Database Commands</summary>

```bash
# Connect to database directly
docker exec -it motorbike-dev-db psql -U postgres -d motorbike_sharing_db

# View database logs
docker logs motorbike-dev-db -f

# Reset database (delete all data)
./dev.sh stop
# When asked about removing data, answer 'y'
```
